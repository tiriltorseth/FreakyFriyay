          <h3>Big Bird</h3>
          <p>
            Big Bird is the main protagonist of the series and the first Muppet to appear on the show.
            He is an 8-foot-tall yellow bird believed by writer Shalom M. Fisch and Dr. Lewis Bernstein
            to be a canary, who resides in a large nest alongside the "123 Sesame Street" building and represents
            the 6-year-old child with his tendency to question everything. On special days, he wears a white collar and colorful necktie.
            Big Bird's best friend is Aloysius Snuffleupagus (better known as "Snuffy"), who was portrayed as the bird's
            imaginary friend until revealed to the human cast in 1985.</p>

          <h3>Oscar the Grouch</h3>
          <p>
            Living outside of the building is Oscar the Grouch, a trash can-dwelling creature belonging to his own unique species,
            who is portrayed as a habitual pessimist and designed to give children "permission to feel grouchy—and to demonstrate
            differing opinions". Oscar and Big Bird were specifically created for the reshooting of the "Street" scenes with the idea
            that they would be able to interact with the human characters. For his part, Oscar has several friends of his own despite his
            pessimism; these include the Grouch's pet worm, Slimey, and his girlfriend Grundgetta.</p>

          <h3>Bert and Ernie</h3>
          <p>
            Two other Muppets who have appeared on the show since its beginning are Bert and Ernie,
            a pair of best friends with contrasting personalities; Ernie is portrayed as a free-spirited
            trickster who loves his rubber duckwhile Bert is the world-weary foil to his friend's naïve trouble-making,
            and shows himself to be obsessed with things like pigeons and paper clips. The debate on these characters'
            sexuality is highly disputed, but as of September 2018, Bert and Ernie are confirmed to not have any sexuality,
            as do the other characters on this list.</p>

          <h3>Cookie Monster</h3>
          <p>
            Also appearing on the show are an unidentified species of furry characters referred to as
            "monsters". Among these are Cookie Monster, a blue monster with a baritone voice, who is addicted
            to the baked goods for which he is named but ironically also likes healthy foods; he will eat anything
            and everything in sight, regardless of whether it's food or not.</p>

          <h3>Elmo</h3>
          <p>
            Elmo became a household name in the show's recent history is Elmo, a small,
            red monster with a falsetto voice, representing the three-year-old child, and usually referring to
            himself from a third person perspective. He is portrayed as friendly and cheerful, he has
            a distinctive giggling laughter, and every so often he falls over backwards to amuse viewers, such as
            in the 2002 video, Elmo Visits the Firehouse. In 1998, Elmo got his own segment occupying the last
            15 minutes of the show, "Elmo's World", in which he explored child-centered topics from two worlds of live
            action and computer animation, which looked like "a child's squiggly crayon drawing come to life".</p>

          <h3>Kermit</h3>
          <p>Born one of several thousand tadpoles in a southern swamp, Kermit’s
            life began swimmingly. His early years were typical, the most notable event being his transformation from
            tadpole to frog. Long before Kermit first appeared on the silver screen, he began his career with a dream.
            With only his talent, banjo, and a song in his heart, a young, green Kermit headed out to make his way in
            the big world of show business. Kermit has hopped to the top of the entertainment pantheon, a feat honored
            in 2002 when the frog was awarded with his own star on The Hollywood Walk of Fame. This event marked the first
            time an amphibian had been honored with this stellar award.</p>
