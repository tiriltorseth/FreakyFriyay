      <p align=center>The team behind this website and the fan club are incredibly dedicated followers
        of the series. Many of us have been involved since the beginning and have devoted
        much of our lives to celebrating this particular series.
        Our team is made up of three equally important factors, the bosses, the watchmen and the helpers.</p>

        <h3>The Managers</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        The managers of the fan club are responsible for keeping track of all the members and being
        present to be able to help the others in the team when needed. They are responsible for the
        commercial around the club and they are the ones who have the main responsibility for the weekly
        magazines the fan club sends out.</p>

        <h3>The Watchmen</h3>
      </div>
      <p> The watchmen of the fanclub and company have one unique task that none of the other departments
        have. Their regular task is to find out what the target group wants to see on the website. They
        also regularly watch the series "Sesame Street" to stay up to date on what is going on in
        the series.</p>

        <h3>The Helpers</h3>
      </div>
      <p>The Helpers of the company works as the customer service. Their job is to stay in touch with
        Sesame Street fans and they have full control over the contactform on the website. Every mail
        that is sent to the fanclub are answered bythe Helpers. They consist of six old ladies with a
        background at the postv office. The Helpers are called helpers since they qork non-profit. The
